## 🚀 The Problem
Scanning samples at atomic resolution (STEM/SEM) is slow and expensive. Researchers waste **90% of beam time** scanning empty background just to find a few rare defects.

## 💡 The Solution
**DeepScan Pro** connects to the microscope and uses **Unsupervised AI** to "look" before it scans.

1.  **See:** Decomposes low-res preview images into neural patches (RegNet/ConvNeXt).
2.  **Think:** Identifies anomalies using Isolation Forests & PCA.
3.  **Act:** Generates a machine-readable protocol to drive the hardware *only* to interesting regions.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Zero-Shot Detection:** Finds defects (cracks, particles, vacancies) without ANY training data.
* **Teacher Mode:** "Human-in-the-loop" functionality. Click one defect, and the AI finds all others instantly.
* **Natural Language Search:** Type *"linear cracks"* and our integrated CLIP model finds them.
* **Protocol Export:** Outputs `.json` coordinates for microscope stage controllers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Core:** Python, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn
* **Vision:** RegNet, ConvNeXt, CLIP (HuggingFace)
* **UI:** Streamlit, Plotly, Matplotlib
* **Math:** UMAP, PCA, Isolation Forests
